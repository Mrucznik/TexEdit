# TexEdit
A tool for editing ingame text in Stronghold

## Usage
The tool will ask for the location of the `sh.tex` file, which is located in your Stronghold
folder. If it loaded successfully, you should be able to view and edit every single line
of text in the game (cool, right?). When you are done, save the file and exit. A backup will
be created in the same directory, in case the game stops working.

## Building
Just fire up your C# compiler of choice, or download a release version.

the inspiration behind this tool!
